# Census Income Prediction - Data Mining Techniques Project 

The following is based on [repo](https://github.com/ckuo7/census_income_prediction)

This data consists of a row per person. There are 40 features associated with each person and the goal is to classify each person as someone who does or does not make over $50,000 per year. Features consist of both numerical (such as age) as well as categorical (such as race) variables. (The original data, features description, and problem can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census-Income+%28KDD%29).)
